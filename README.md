<h1>Non-Administrative-users</h1>
In this tutorial, we will learn how to set up Remote Desktop access for non-administrative users on Client-1, and then create multiple domain user accounts in Active Directory using a PowerShell script. By the end of the lab, weâ€™ll be able to log into Client-1 with one of these newly created normal user accounts and test Remote Desktop connectivity.

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Windows Server 2022

<h2>ðŸ”‘ Prerequisites</h2>

You already have a working domain (mydomain.com).

You are logged into Client-1 with the account mydomain.com\jane_admin.

Active Directory is installed and running on DC-1.

</p>
<p>
Enable Remote Desktop for Non-Administrative Users Log into Client-1 as mydomain.com\jane_admin. Press Windows + R, type sysdm.cpl, and hit Enter to open System Properties.

Go to the Remote tab.

Under Remote Desktop, select Allow remote connections to this computer.

Click on Select Users â†’ Add.

Type Domain Users â†’ click Check Names â†’ then OK.

This gives all normal users in the domain permission to use RDP.

Apply and close the settings.

âœ… Now, any non-administrative user in the domain can log into Client-1 via Remote Desktop.

Bulk Create Domain Users with PowerShell

Log into DC-1 as mydomain.com\jane_admin.

Open PowerShell ISE as Administrator.

Create a new script file and paste in the provided script (this script creates multiple new users in the _EMPLOYEES OU).

Save and run the script.

Observe the creation process in the PowerShell output.

Open Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC).

Navigate to the _EMPLOYEES OU.

Attempt to log into Client-1 using one of the new accounts created by the script.

Use the password defined in the script.

Confirm that the login is successful.
